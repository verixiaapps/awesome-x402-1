## What is x402?

x402 is an open protocol that uses HTTP status code 402 (Payment Required) to enable machine-to-machine micropayments for API access. AI agents, scripts, and applications can discover, pay for, and consume API services programmatically without API keys, subscriptions, or credit cards.
